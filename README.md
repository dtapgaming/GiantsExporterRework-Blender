Installation - drag the Zip and drop it into blenders Viewport. You may be prompted to disable conflicting addons (there are 2) to use this addon you MUST disable both if you have them (they are built into this addon so you wont be missing them they are just included).


Now that the addon is installed open your side panel (Shortcut N) then click on the Giants I3D Exporter REWORKED tab

 then click

 you will get a Pop-Up 

<img width="1059" height="603" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51a544dd-f2e3-49bb-b4c2-977d5f41c188" />

set your game installation path at the bottom

IF you have not granted internet access to Blender itself and you want to get the updates to this addon without having to go to gitHub, then select Enable Online Access button (this ONLY shows if the enable Update Checks (Internet) box is checked)

<img width="1061" height="942" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa98ad13-eed8-4a38-b944-87887d5ee6e6" />

then close this window and all of the warnings will go away
 
<img width="297" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e267a2-3894-48cd-ae06-ebd74514a31a" />

****UPDATE LOGIC**** 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

an update that gets pushed for this update will alert you if its availible when you start a blender session as long as you have Internet access enabled in Blender and the enable Update Checks (Internet) box is checked in your User Preferences in this same location you can choose what build you would like to opt into (STABLE/BETA/ALPHA).

this is an example of what an update prompt looks like on startup

<img width="645" height="613" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ceb917-64bf-478a-ad92-d2236560792a" />

Be sure to pay special attention to this section:

<img width="578" height="169" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d63165-fbfd-4a7f-bc96-2efb7435ef3c" />

once you click Update either move your mouse up and down till the prompt changes or goes away or click out of it right away and watch the bottom left corner of blender 

<img width="701" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c163c2c-18a3-4308-aeba-40d151c1c511" />

just to the right of this GIANTS I3D quick access about menu it will show "downloading update" and "update complete" (it happens really fast)

if you get this popup after moving your mouse around after the update like mentioned above

<img width="1214" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/813308de-7c34-4287-862a-375be779819c" />

you can just click out of it this is a Minor Bug Im working on resolving but im getting stuck on fixing because it happens as the installation is happening of the new version.

Please Note: I haven't tested everything like splines tools, joint creation, array creation, and more complex things as I shouldn't have changed anything that broke those (in theory) let me know if there is issues with them.

Bug reports can be on this GitHub OR in your user prefferences you can select

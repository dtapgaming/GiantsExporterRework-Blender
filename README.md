----------

V 10.0.11 (8.12.2025) Build: ALPHA1
------------------
- Updated reworked version for Farming Simulator 25 By DTAPGAMING 

- Moved Game Installation Path browser into Preference addon menu - (this allows for a persistent game install location so you no longer have to select your install location every time you launch blender)
- Reworked GUI to better fit new persistent game install location features - If you set the wrong folder just go into Blender > Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Giants I3D Exporter Tools Reworked> at the bottom is your install Location!
- Reworked Logic to allow all built-in tools to work with new persistent game install location - Just click the magnifying glass for shaders in material tab once you set the game install path it will work from then on out! 
<img width="458" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131d6c50-f2b5-42f6-a3ca-59e0e2ba7ea7" />

You will need the game install location set to use the Material Templates as well

- Added Emission Nullifier Option (no longer need to drag the slider of emissions to black or deal with annoyances in Giants Editor if you forgot) 
<img width="436" height="120" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea55136b-bdc4-4ec8-b56a-3a5471a01124" />

- Removed the "Game relative" and "Relative" path options from export Tab and built real logic into back end, no longer needs a users input to properly route file paths.


Please Note: This is an Alpha Build so there will probably be bugs and maybe even some base features that broke I pre-alpha tested a lot of the features but I haven't tested everything like vertex painting and more complex things as I should have changed anything that broke those (in theory)
